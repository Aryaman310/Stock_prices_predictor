##Stock Price Predictor

The stock price predictor is a project that introduces neural networks and illustrates an example of how one can use neural networks to predict stock prices. It equips the LSTM (Long-short term memory) and MLP (multilayer perceptron) models.

The overall workflow for this project is as such:

1. Acquire the stock price data - this will give us our features for the model.
2. Preprocess the data - make the train and test datasets.
3. Use the neural network to learn from the training data.
4. Backtest the model across a date range.
5. Make useful stock price predictions
6. Supplement your trading strategies with the predictions
